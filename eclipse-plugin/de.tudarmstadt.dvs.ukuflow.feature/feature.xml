      ukuFlow is a workflow engine for wireless sensor networks and energy-efficient networked embedded devices. With ukuFlow, developers model the application logic using processes, or workflows, as programming abstraction. This macroprogramming approach enables domain experts to focus on the application logic, hiding away low-level system issues.

BPMN2uku is a Plug-In for Eclipse that provides support for validating and converting a uWDL (a subset of BPMN2) process to ukuFlowâ€™s bytecode, and therefore facilitate the usage of the ukuFlow engine.
