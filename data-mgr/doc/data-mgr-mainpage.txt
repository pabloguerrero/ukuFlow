\mainpage Sensor and Actuator Network Data Management

Sensor networks are composed of nodes uniquely characterized by properties beyond their beyond network address and physical
position. Ever more deployments consist of heterogeneous sensor and actuator nodes, which requires them to manage different
data structures and items. In large scale networks, a centralized approach to manage this information leads to high data 
inconsistencies. We employ a bottom up approach where each node is responsible for managing its own set of data repositories.      
This service aims at providing a simple API to data repository which takes into consideration the storage constrains (small
RAM, energy-costly flash access)
