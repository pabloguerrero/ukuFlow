\mainpage Sensor and Actuator Network Data Management

Sensor networks are composed of nodes uniquely characterized by properties beyond their beyond network address and physical
position. Ever more deployments consist of heterogeneous sensor and actuator nodes, which requires them to manage different
data structures and items.  

centralized approach doesn't scale, inconsistency. But distribution is hindered by storage constrains (small RAM, energy-costly flash access)

This service aims at providing a simple API to data repository which takes
