\mainpage Sensor and Actuator Network Data Management

Sensor networks are composed of nodes uniquely characterized by properties beyond their network address and physical
position. Ever more deployments consist of heterogeneous sensor and actuator nodes, which requires them to manage different
data structures and items. In large scale networks, a centralized approach to the management of this information leads to frequent
data inconsistencies. 

We employ a bottom up approach where each node is responsible for managing its own set of data repositories.      
This service aims at providing a simple API to a data repository which takes into consideration the storage constrains (small
RAM and energy-costly flash access). Variable length data items can be stored and associated with an input function, e.g. a
sensor input. Instead of assuming a polling strategy which typically incurs into high energy costs, entries are given a time-to-live
value, whose expiration signals the need for an update.  Input functions are provided for built-in sensors, but can be any 
arbitrary C functions providing a data item to be stored into the data repository.

The data management service running on a node enables the creation of multiple repositories. Each application could open a repository,
or allocate multiple for different uses. Input from data items that is common between repositories, such as sensor data, isn't 
requested multiple times, but shared by means of a hidden internal repository. The input frequency is thus that of the repository
with lowest ttl.
