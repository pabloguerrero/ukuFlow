\mainpage The ukuFlow Workflow Engine Macroprogramming System

ukuFlow is a multi-tasking workflow engine for memory-efficient
networked embedded systems and wireless
sensor networks.

ukuFlow adopts BPMN 2.0 as standard for modeling and executing processes.

Since ukuFlow is implemented on top of Contiki, it runs on a variety
of platforms from embedded microcontrollers such as the MSP430 and the AVR to old
homecomputers.

ukuFlow is written in the C programming language.

\section ukuflow-mainpage-bpmn BPMN

ukuFlow adopts the Business Process Model and Notation (BPMN) v2.0 (http://www.bpmn.org/),
which is a standard notation.

Scopes a lightweight framework for defining groups of nodes declaratively.

Scopes is built using the Rime communication stacks from Contiki.

\section contiki-mainpage-threads Multi-programming

ukuFlow's workflow engine is designed to execute multiple processes simultaneously.
System users can register multiple processes, each of which can have multiple instances running in pseudo-parallel.
ukuFlow's engine leverages Contiki's protothreads to parallelize the process execution, while ensuring that the network 
doesn't get congested with event subscriptons, sensor events and action commands.


\section ukuflow-mainpage-getting-started Getting started with ukuFlow

ukuFlow is being constantly tested on TUDuNet, the testbeds deployed at the TUD. For more information on this, please visit http://www.tudunet.tu-darmstadt.de
